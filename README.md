# Program that notifies you when a course is open 

This program uses [Selenium Webdriver]("https://www.seleniumhq.org/") to automate checking course status on UWaterloo's quest portal. Whenever the course of interest is open, the program notifies a user.  
Currently headless PhantomJS driver and browser-based ChromeDrive are supported.  


### TO-DO:  
- [x] Implement course status inquiries with Selenium Webdriver
- [x] Implement notifications when a course opens
- [ ] Send a text message / email to the user once the course is open
- [ ] Automatically register a user for a course
